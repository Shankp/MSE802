### 1. Why is division by 0 not possible?


We can’t divide any number by zero because there’s no number that, when multiplied by zero, gives the original number. In real math, that means it’s undefined. In programming, it usually throws an error.

The reverse of division is multiplication.  
For example:  
If \( 6 / 0 = x \), then \( x \times 0 = 6 \).  
Here, it is not valid as there is no number that can be multiplied by 0 to get 6.

### 2. Why are different frequencies used in different countries?

Power system frequency is how quickly the AC voltage or current’s phase angle changes, measured in hertz (Hz). One hertz means one cycle per second. The frequency depends on how fast the generators spin—faster rotation gives a higher frequency. It also affects how electrical equipment is designed and how well it works.

Historically, countries experimented with various frequencies for economic, practical, and historical reasons, ranging from 16.67 Hz to over 130 Hz. As power systems evolved, standardization led to two main frequencies:  
- Europe and much of Asia use 50 Hz  
- North America and parts of Latin America use 60 Hz  
- Japan uses both 50 Hz and 60 Hz

Each frequency has pros and cons. 50 Hz tends to have lower transmission losses but requires larger, heavier equipment. 60 Hz allows for lighter motors and transformers but loses a bit more energy in transmission. The choice is mostly historical rather than technical.
